## Phase 1 — Calendar Module — COMPLETE (2026-06-20)

### Exit Criteria (all verified on live Vercel URL)
- [x] OAuth flow works — clicking Connect redirects to Google
- [x] After auth, tokens row exists in Supabase tokens table
- [x] Sync button fetches real events — calendar_events table populates
- [x] Week view displays events in correct time slots
- [x] Day view displays events in timeline
- [x] Home dashboard calendar strip shows real today's events
- [x] No console errors on any route
- [x] Deployed to Vercel and working on live URL
- [x] PROGRESS.md updated

### What was built
- `api/auth/google.js` — OAuth redirect with offline access + calendar.readonly scope
- `api/auth/callback.js` — code exchange, token upsert to Supabase
- `api/calendar-sync.js` — token refresh, -28d/+56d window, upsert on google_event_id
- `src/hooks/useCalendar.js` — isConnected, events, sync, view, navigate
- `src/components/calendar/ConnectPrompt.jsx`
- `src/components/calendar/CalendarHeader.jsx`
- `src/components/calendar/EventBlock.jsx` — absolute grid positioning
- `src/components/calendar/WeekView.jsx` — 7-column grid, all-day row, current time indicator
- `src/components/calendar/DayView.jsx` — single-day timeline
- `src/pages/Calendar.jsx` — three states: loading / disconnected / connected
- `src/pages/Home.jsx` — live today events from Supabase
- `vercel.json` — SPA rewrite so api/ serverless functions are reachable

### Fix applied this session
`vercel.json` was missing, causing Vercel's Vite preset to 404 on `/api/auth/callback`. Added minimal SPA rewrite — Vercel checks serverless functions before applying rewrites, so API routes are unaffected.
